    This node allows you to apply a NOT gate to a 'target' qubit if the 'control' qubit is in the '1' state. <br/>
    The NOT gate inverses the qubit state: 0 -> 1 & 1 -> 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this, connect two qubits as input and indicate whether the
    target is the visually upper or visually lower qubit, out of the two input qubits.
    <br /><br />
    Now, let's assume the 'target' qubit is in the '0' state. <br />
    If the 'control' qubit is in a <b>superposition</b> state (25% '0' / 75% '1'),
    then the resulting state of the 2 qubits will be:
    <ul>
      <li>'00' with 25% probability</li>
      <li>'11' with 75% probability</li>
    </ul>
    The 2 qubits are now connected by a 'spooky' phenomenon called <b>entanglement</b>.
    <br /><br />
    In terms of the <b>Bloch Sphere</b> (see 'Details' below), 
    this corresponds to a reflection of the sphere along the x-axis of the 'target' qubit.<br/>
    The 'control' qubit state is not affected.

      Qubit objects can be generated from:
      <ul>
        <li>'Quantum circuit' node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
        <li>'Quantum register' node along with 'Quantum circuit' in 'Register & bits' mode.</li>

      Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.

    <h5>Qubit State</h5>
    <p>
      A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.
      <br /><br />
      <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#statevectors"> Classical vs Quantum bits - Qiskit textbook</a>
      <br /><br />
      The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
      <br /><br />
      In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
      In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
      <ul>
        <li>State 0</li>
        <li>State 1</li>
      </ul>
      Quantum states that are in between those 2 points are a weighted combination of the '0' and '1' states. This is called <b>superposition</b>. <br/>
      To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

    <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
    <p>
      It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
      <br/><br/>
      Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
      <br /><br />
      This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
      In practice, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements.
