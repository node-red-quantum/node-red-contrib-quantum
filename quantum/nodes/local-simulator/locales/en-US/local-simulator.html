      This node simulates the operation of a quantum circuit and returns a simulated output.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, indicate the number of times you would like to simulate the circuit (shots),
      place this node at the end of the quantum circuit and 
      connect all qubit objects.
      <br />
      If not all qubit objects are connected, the node will assume that 
      the circuit has not finished running and will wait indefinitely.
      <br /><br />
      The <b>output of a quantum circuit</b> correspond to the value of the classical bits that were set up with the circuit. <br />
      The <i>Measure</i> node is the only node capable of changing a classical bit value. Simulating a quantum circuit
      without any <i>Measure</i> nodes will simply result in all the shots generating the same number: the default classical 
      bits value (e.g. 000 for 3 bits).
      <br /><br />
      The number of shots refers to the number of times the circuit is run to obtain
      a probability distribution of results. This is due to the probabilistic nature of qubit measurements.<br />
      The 'counts' refer to the number of shots that resulted in each output of the circuit.<br />
      For more information about qubit measurements, please refer to the <i>Measure</i> node documentation.
      <br /><br />
      This node makes use of Qiskit's local QASM simulator. <br/>

        A dictionary where each key correspond to a different output (e.g. 00, 01, 10, 11) and
        the associated value is the count: the number of shots that simulated this output.
        <br /><br />
        To illustrate, a two qubits circuit simulated with 1000 shots could output:<br/>
        {00: 25, 01: 925, 10: 25, 11: 25}

    <h3>Details</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Qubit objects can be generated from:
        <ul>
        <li><i>Quantum Circuit</i> node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
        <li><i>Quantum Register</i> node along with <i>Quantum Circuit</i> in 'Register' mode.</li>
        </ul>
        Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.
        <br /><br />
